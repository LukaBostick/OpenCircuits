## Background

Super Circuits is an open source Single Flux Quantum circuit designer, based on OpenCircuits, which was created by [Leon Montealegre](https://leonmontealegre.com/), originally for an independent study for [Professor Paul Wilkinson](http://www.drpjw.org/) of Pasadena City College.
OpenCircuits is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/OpenCircuits).

## Overview

A prototype website to create a user-friendly, SPICE-like way to visualize and create Single Flux Quantum (SQF) circuits, based off of OpenCircuit, and with integration from JoSIM. Eventually, we want to fully-realize this software by building it from scratch, to be as efficient, and as accurate as possible.



## Context

SQF circuits are, in a way, the future of computing. Using Josephson Junctions, they create a supercurrent, a type of current with no resistance, allowing for very fast computing, with extremely efficient power draw. 

Right now, there is no program that allows for easy creation of SQF circuits. By creating a simple visualization software, with intuitive controls, there will be a much lower skill-ceiling in the creation and learning of superconductive circuits. 

This tool was made to be used in educational setting, where its simplicity will make learning about SQF circuits much easier, as well as the professional setting, where its simple and intuitve nature will increase efficiency.



## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals:
- (list out each goal/feature)

### Non-Goals:
- (list of things you DON'T plan on doing in this feature)



## Milestones

<Timeline 
    start="11/5/2023" 
    milestones={[{
        date: "Date 1",
        explanation: "Brief explanation",
    }, {
        date: "Date 2",
        explanation: "Brief explanation",
    }, {
        date: "Date 3",
        explanation: "Brief explanation",
    }]} 
    end="End Date" />



## Existing Solution

(describe if the issue/feature is already doable and how it's doable)



## Proposed Solution

(write a specific "walk-through" of how the solution fixes the problem)



## Alternative Solutions

- (describe other considered solutions and explain why they were not chosen)



## Testability

(describe how the issue/feature will be tested)



## Impact

(does this impact other parts of the project? i.e. potentially exposes security vulnerabilities,
 causes lag? What are some of the negative consequences and side effects?)



## Known Unknowns

(describe open issues that you aren't sure about)



## Detailed Scoping

(breakdown exactly HOW you plan on executing each part of the project,
go in order of when you plan doing each part as well
THIS IS THE PLACE TO VERY TECHNICAL ABOUT EXACT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE THE LONGEST PART OF THE DESIGN DOC)
