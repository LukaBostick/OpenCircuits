## Usage

Instructions and tutorials located in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/OpenCircuits/wiki).

## Background

Super Circuits is an open source Single Flux Quantum circuit designer, based on OpenCircuits, which was created by [Leon Montealegre](https://leonmontealegre.com/), originally for an independent study for [Professor Paul Wilkinson](http://www.drpjw.org/) of Pasadena City College.
OpenCircuits is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/OpenCircuits).

## Overview

A prototype website to create a user-friendly, SPICE-like way to visualize and create Single Flux Quantum (SQF) circuits, based off of OpenCircuit, and with integration from JoSIM. Eventually, we want to fully-realize this software by building it from scratch, to be as efficient, and as accurate as possible.



## Context

SQF circuits are, in a way, the future of computing. Using Josephson Junctions, they create a supercurrent, a type of current with no resistance, allowing for very fast computing, with extremely efficient power draw. 

Right now, there is no program that allows for easy creation of SQF circuits. By creating a simple visualization software, with intuitive controls, there will be a much lower skill-ceiling in the creation and learning of superconductive circuits. 

This tool was made to be used in educational setting, where its simplicity will make learning about SQF circuits much easier, as well as the professional setting, where its simple and intuitve nature will increase efficiency.
