     2. # Figure 2. DQFP gates. (a) Inverter. L1 = L2 = 1.48 pH, Lq1 = Lq2 = 3.27 pH, Lin = 0.361 pH, and Lout = 0.806 pH. (b) Buffer, which is an AQFP gate without signal transformers. L1 = L2 = 1.44 pH, Lq = 5.40 pH, Lin = 11.9 pH, and Lout = 2.50 pH. The critical currents of J1 and J2 are 50 Î¼A. J1 and J2 are not damped by resistors [Verification](//Simulation/pi_DQFP_inverter_chain.md)
